## Overview of the statistical analysis
For this challenge, the user tries to convince some investors to invest in the user's idea, which is to open a surf shop "Surf n 'Shake" in Hawaii. For the challenge, an analysis of the climate of the city was carried out with the objective of showing, based on graphs, the climate of Oahu in the months of June to December.

The analysis was carried out on a simple web page created in Flask using Python to create a more friendly and understandable environment so that members can visualize the behavior of Oahu's weather during those months.
